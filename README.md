Redfish Prompt: A clone of HTTP Prompt
======================================

This is an experimental extension of the http-prompt tool intended to be a playground to add Redfish-specific capabilities (see the Redfish pages at DMTF.org for more information on Redfish).

Documentation below is the same as that of http-prompt and does not yet include any details on the Redfish-specific extensions.
